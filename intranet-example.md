<p><em>Imagine this is your intranet.</em></p>
<p><em>Now imagine that the video below contains instructions that employees need when they are near a specific printer.</em></p>

**Boom!**

## Work smarter
Wasn't that magical? Using the power of tech wizardry we just made your phone teach you how to use an imaginary printer. (Of course if you were using this app for reals then you could have made that link go to any page on your intranet or the internet.)

By creating a smart workplace you can provide instructions about how to use a printer, or anything really, at the right time and place (literally). Relevant information pushed to your phone in context (when and where you need it).

* No more searching through a sea of endless pages on the intranet for some basic information.
* No need to rely on training you did eight months ago when you started working here.

<!--Plus, digital information is better because:

* it's easier to maintain
* it won't rip or fall off the wall
* it's not limited by the size of a piece of paper-->
